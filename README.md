> The project was created as part of the learning process.

## Project Description
The main goal of the project was to practically utilize all the capabilities of `CSS Grid` for building the entire layout of the page and small components.
In combination with the use of `rem`, `vw`, and `vh`, as well as adaptive typography (utilizing the `css-function (clamp)`), it was possible to implement a practically fluid responsive design with minimal style changes for specific media queries.

### Technologies and Methodologies:
* HTML, CSS, JS
* BEM Methodology
* SASS Preprocessor
* CSS Grid, Flexbox
* Gulp

### Independently developed features (including creating the markup, styles, and scripts):
1. Modal window with feedback form
2. Burger menu
